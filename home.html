                        Offline Matters is a handbook for anybody experiencing digital overload in their lives and creative work. Part insider exposé, part worker-manual, this book is for any creative seeking help on: <br><br>

                            <li style="list-style-type:square">Navigating the possibility of offline alternatives</li>

                        <br>
                        ... away from the confines of our screens. We are dreaming of offline. Not as a romanticised past, a punishment, a quick detox, or a WiFi-free café. Offline is not a <i>lifestyle</i>. It’s a space of opportunity. <br> <br>
                        By the end of Offline Matters, you’ll have a new perspective on the dry digitality that defines creative work today – and a set of strategies for going beyond it.

                    Jess Henderson (pseud.) founded Outsider while working as a brand strategist at numerous prominent creative agencies. Outsider was a critical space for industry insiders exploring the possibilities of ‘offline’ in the realm of creative work. Beginning as a subversive email newsletter titled ‘Outsider Weekly’*, Outsider became a mysterious cult figure in the industry through its opinion pieces and counter-cultural ideas, experiments, and events. <br><br>This book culminates three years of research conducted under the project and is also its sweet kiss goodbye. Jess now works as a writer, theorist, and activist interested in the impact of technology on our everyday lives. Today she writes, speaks, and teaches workshops on the missed opportunity of offline connections and its fallout on both workers and audiences.

                ‘Jess Henderson, the guerrillera behind enemy lines, created Outsider; an anarchic newsletter/witty rant against the establishment, and the pervasive contentment with boredom and same old marketing bullshit. Someone had to say it, and thank god it was Jess. Her persistent brilliance kept bombing my inbox, and my joy. 
                I waited in anticipation, sometimes for months, to receive news from the trenches and one of my favorite wounded soldiers was writing these messages in digital bottles. Just like the white space between the lines in a book, it was like reading every unsaid truth, every unheard sigh or roll of the eyes in our industry. 
                I love hearing from Jess. The way she made me not feel alone in trying to dynamite the industry from within and her persistent encouragement to light up the spark. Thank you Jess. We need <i>Offline Matters.</i>’ <br>
