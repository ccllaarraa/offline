                    <i>Offline Matters</i>  is a handbook of radical strategies for today’s creative worker. The guide blows open the true state of creative work today where digital solutions are doctrine, overwork culture results in burnouts and ideas churn out into depressing marketing noise. <br><br>
                        We’re dreaming of offline. Not offline as a romanticised past, a punishment, quick detox, or WiFi-free café. Offline is not a <i>lifestyle</i>. It’s a space of possibility.<br><br>
                        A wake-up for the digital age, Offline Matters is pro-flourishing rather than anti-technology. Take this countercultural ride through an offline-first approach to creative work.

                    Jess Henderson (pseud.) is an Amsterdam-based writer, theorist and activist interested in offline life, creativity-as-work, and alternative ways of life. In 2017 she founded Outsider, a critical space exploring the possibilities of ‘offline’ in the realm of creative work, while working as a brand strategist at numerous prominent creative agencies. Today she writes, speaks, and holds workshops on the missed opportunity of offline connections, and the affects on both workers and audiences that comes with it. With this book’s release the persona of Jess closes, continuing under the new name of <a href="https://www.no-fun.tips" target="_blank">Ruth Les</a>, who can be found at <a href="https://www.no-fun.tips" target="_blank">www.no-fun.tips</a>

                    <span class="pt">WHAT IS OUTSIDER?</span><br>
                    <i>Offline Matters</i> is a compendium based on three years of research under the Outsider project. Outsider was born to question the eradication of offline considerations from creative work, where ‘social media’ has rapidly become the solution to every problem. Beginning as a subversive email newsletter titled Outsider Weekly, the voice became a cult figure in the industry through its opinion pieces and obscure ideas, experiments, and events. Nobody knew who ‘Outsider’ was. As it turns out, Outsider is all of us – creative workers around the world suffering under the same exploitative conditions. Experiencing the same bizarre circumstances. The full back catalogue of Outsider writings can be found here. RIP Outsider.

                ‘For any creative who has had to cater to corporate dimwits in order support their art, here's a terrific guide to bringing your best work into the commercial sphere without selling out or compromising your craft. This is a book about how to break free from the data-driven expectations of your client's spreadsheet, and retrieve the true novelty that makes you valuable in the first place.’ <br>

                ‘This book is extremely timely. The pandemic has obliged everybody to stay online almost all the time. <i>Offline Matters</i> reminds us that life is (also) elsewhere. The neologism ‘offline’, which did not exist twenty years ago, has philosophical relevance. This book is hoping us to discover it.’ <br>

Fortunately Jess Henderson has arrived to help us get offline, not into the pasts but into the presence of our lives.

                Anyone seeking encouragement, inspiration, moral support, and IDEAS would do well to study these pages, preferably in a solitary room with no music playing and no laptop showing ‘news’ (or a cellphone constantly pinging). Electronics in another room, please!’ <br>

                ‘Jess Henderson, the guerrillera behind enemy lines, created Outsider; an anarchic newsletter/witty rant against the establishment, and the pervasive contentment with boredom and same old marketing bullshit. Someone had to say it, and thank god it was Jess. Her persistent brilliance kept bombing my inbox, and my joy. 
                I waited in anticipation, sometimes for months, to receive news from the trenches and one of my favorite wounded soldiers was writing these messages in digital bottles. Just like the white space between the lines in a book, it was like reading every unsaid truth, every unheard sigh or roll of the eyes in our industry. 
                I love hearing from Jess. The way she made me not feel alone in trying to dynamite the industry from within and her persistent encouragement to light up the spark. Thank you Jess. We need <i>Offline Matters.</i>’ <br>
