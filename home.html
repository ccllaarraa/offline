                            When did creative work become so boring? <br>
                            How did ‘digital-first’ come to dominate everything? <br>
                            …And why is nobody talking about it? <br><br>

                    <i>Offline Matters</i>  is a handbook of radical strategies for today’s creative worker. The guide blows open the true state of creative work today where digital solutions are doctrine, overwork culture results in burnouts and ideas churn out into depressing marketing noise. <br><br>
                        We’re dreaming of offline. Not offline as a romanticised past, a punishment, quick detox, or WiFi-free café. Offline is not a <i>lifestyle</i>. It’s a space of possibility.<br><br>
                        A wake-up for the digital age, Offline Matters is pro-flourishing rather than anti-technology. Take this countercultural ride through an offline-first approach to creative work.

                ‘<i>Offline Matters</i> is a much needed take-down of the whole 'cult of creativity' from the inside. This rattle gun attack on the perniciousness of the creative digital work will leave you aghast and amused in equal measure.’ <br>

                    Jess Henderson (pseud.) is an Amsterdam-based writer, theorist and activist interested in offline life, creativity-as-work, and alternative ways of life. In 2017 she founded Outsider, a critical space exploring the possibilities of ‘offline’ in the realm of creative work, while working as a brand strategist at numerous prominent creative agencies. Today she writes, speaks, and holds workshops on the missed opportunity of offline connections, and the affects on both workers and audiences that comes with it. With this book’s release the persona of Jess closes, continuing under the new name of <a href="https://www.no-fun.tips" target="_blank">Ruth Les</a>, who can be found at <a href="https://www.no-fun.tips" target="_blank">www.no-fun.tips</a>

                    <span class="pt">WHAT IS OUTSIDER?</span><br>
                    <i>Offline Matters</i> is a compendium based on three years of research under the Outsider project. Outsider was born to question the eradication of offline considerations from creative work, where ‘social media’ has rapidly become the solution to every problem. Beginning as a subversive email newsletter titled Outsider Weekly, the voice became a cult figure in the industry through its opinion pieces and obscure ideas, experiments, and events. Nobody knew who ‘Outsider’ was. As it turns out, Outsider is all of us – creative workers around the world suffering under the same exploitative conditions. Experiencing the same bizarre circumstances. The full back catalogue of Outsider writings can be found here. RIP Outsider.
